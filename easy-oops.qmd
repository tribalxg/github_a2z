Let's start with the easiest skills and the easiest problems to fix.

- git checkout
- git reset (soft vs hard)
- git commit — amend
- Correct typos in commit messages
- Undo a commit
- Revert back to a previous version (and throw away the changes made since then)
- What do you do if you pull and find there are conflicts it can’t resolve?
